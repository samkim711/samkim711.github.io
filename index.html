        <p><strong>Alternate Proof of the Generating Function for Central Binomial Coefficients</strong> This is a proof of the generating function using simple trigonometric identities and integrals.</p>
        <p><strong>Expanding the formula for the sum of the first k powers</strong> This goes beyond on how to find a generic formula for the sum of the first k powers. </p>
        <p><strong>Slides for the Minimal Flow of Aut(G)</strong> This is the slides I used when I was presenting some results from our research.
        <p><strong>Extension of the Integration Packet</strong>This is a document expanding upon Archeon's guide to integrals.</p>
